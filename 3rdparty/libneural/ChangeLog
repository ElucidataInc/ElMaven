Newer version of libtool and a change from (s)random() to (s)rand() mean it
now works on Solaris (and a reduction in randomness on this platform is not
a major issue - on Linux random() is just as good as rand()).

Minor buglet fixed, thanks to Ole-Morten Duesund and Will Andrews. Now
compiles with gcc 2.95.2, and works under FreeBSD.

Portability changes - should now compile under NT. Replaced random srandom
with rand and srand, replaced \n with endl in the function for writing
weight files. Thanks to <look up the guy's name> for pointing these out.

Fixed silly omission in the headers - now check to see if they are already
included.

29/9/1998

Minor changes to char_recognition.cc, marginal code reduction. Start
thinking about changes for 1.1.

26/9/98

Released version 1.0

20/9/98

Preparing for initial release. Packaged up using autoconf / automake /
libtool. Expect to release around Saturday 26/9/98.

11/11/98 

Attempted to introduce both bias terms and momentum term. The
former produced no noticable speed improvement, whereas the latter seemed to
slow it down ... probably could be made to work with some more effort and
code rearrangement. Also tried a "fast BPN" algorithm... again, no great
improvement. Probably this is a consequence of the design of the network
code.

Wrote a demonstration application for character recognition. It seems to
work very well.

4/9/98 

Got the network working for the first time today. It can be trained to
recognise odd and even numbers. Not much, but it works.
