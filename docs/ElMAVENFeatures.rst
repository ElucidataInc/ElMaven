El-MAVEN Features
=================

`Maven <http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/mzroll/index.php>`_ and 
`El-MAVEN <https://elucidatainc.github.io/ElMaven/>`_ share the following features:

   * Multi-file chromatographic aligner

   * Peak-feature detector

   * Isotope and adduct calculator

   * Formula predictor

   * Pathway visualizer

   * Isotopic flux animator

El-MAVEN is faster, more robust and has more user friendly features as compared to Maven.
